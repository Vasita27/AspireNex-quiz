Project Description: Quiz Website This project is a dynamic and interactive Quiz Website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application allows users to create, search, and play quizzes, as well as view and manage their own quizzes. Key features of the website include:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. Authentication is implemented to ensure personalized user experiences and data protection. Quiz Creation: Authenticated users can create quizzes with multiple questions and options. The quizzes are stored in a MongoDB database. Quiz Search and Play: Users can search for quizzes by name and attempt them. The application dynamically fetches quiz data and displays questions with multiple-choice options. Score Calculation: After completing a quiz, users receive their score immediately, giving instant feedback on their performance. Quiz Management: Users can view a list of quizzes they have created, with options to edit or delete them. This is achieved through a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons. Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Technical Stack: Frontend: React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface. Backend: Node.js and Express.js for creating a robust and scalable server-side application. Database: MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of quiz data. Styling: CSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

How to Run? 1.Clone the repository 2.npm start for front end 3.Navigate to backend directory 4.nodemon index.js to connect it.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
